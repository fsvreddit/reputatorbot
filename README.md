ReputatorBot is a bot that allows users to award reputation points if a user has been helpful. Its main intention is to be used on help and advice subreddits to help indicate users who have a track record of providing useful solutions.

It allows the OP of a post, a mod, or a trusted user to reply to a user and award them a point using a bot command, which will be stored as their user flair (optional from v1.2) and stored in a data store. The command can be customisable (by default it is `!thanks`).

The app gets triggered when a comment is posted or edited, but only never award points twice per comment. It triggers on edit to give the user chance to amend a comment to add the "thanks" command if they forget initially.

You can also set an optional post flair if a point is awarded, such as to mark the question as "Resolved".

The app has backup and restore functionality from 1.4 onwards, which enables points to be preserved if you uninstall the app or if you want to import data from a previous reputation points app. For technical details of this function, please [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fsvapps/wiki/reputatorbotbackup/).

## Custom Post

By using the subreddit ... menu, you can create a custom post that shows the current leaderboard. You can choose the post title and the number of users to show on the leaderboard.

## Limitations

* The optional leaderboard will not pull in points for users until this app awards one. If you have previously used /u/Clippy_Office_Asst or a similar bot to award reputation points in the past, this will make the leaderboard misleading unless you restore from a backup.
* For flair setting options, if you specify both a CSS class and a flair template, the flair template will be used.

## Suggestions

You may wish to create an automod rule that detects phrases like "thank you" and similar in comments that do not have the trigger command, and reply suggesting that they use the command.

I strongly recommend using a command that is not going to be used in "normal" comments, to avoid awarding points accidentally. If you use a ! prefix e.g. !thanks, you will reduce the risk of accidental points awarding.

I recommend testing settings out on a test subreddit before deploying to a real subreddit for the first time.

## Data Stored

This application stores the reputation score awarded by the app for each user in a Redis data store and (if configured) as the user's flair. It also stores a record that a comment has had a point awarded on it for a period of a week after that point is awarded.

If the application is removed from a subreddit, all data is deleted although the flairs will remain. If the application is subsequently re-installed, the existing flairs will be used as a basis for new point awarding.

Data for users is removed from the app within 48 hours from v1.3 onwards.

## Version History

### Version 1.4.8

* No user facing changes. Check frequency reduced to 28 days, Devvit version bump and internal code improvements.

### Version 1.4

* Add custom post type to allow a leaderboard to be pinned to the top of your subreddit
* Allow a configurable number of scores on the leaderboard
* Backup and Restore functionality
* Reduce data cleanup interval to 48 hours

### Version 1.3

* The leaderboard is now updated immediately after a point is awarded, if that point would affect the leaderboard standings.
* You can now exclude posts with certain flairs from allowing points to be awarded.
* If a user deletes their account, their data will be removed from the app within 24 hours.

### Version 1.2

* You can now award points without setting user flair at all if you wish. Points are maintained in the background and the score is visible on the leaderboard (if turned on).
* The message that can be configured when a point is successfully awarded has a new placeholder {{points}} indicating the new score.

### Version 1.1

* You can now use the placeholder {{permalink}} in replies when you award a point or try and self-award.
* Super users must now use the mod command, not the command that the OP would use. This allows super users to remind people how to award points without accidentally awarding one themselves.
* You can now set a points threshold for users to be automatically considered "trusted".
